I am a medical doctor with over a decade of experience in both the NHS and private sectors.

My passion lies in health, wellbeing, and personalised medicine. I have undertaken extensive training in areas such as functional medicine, hormonal health, cardiometabolic health and health optimisation.

I take pride in dedicating ample time to understand each patient's unique story so that together, we can develop a tailored plan you feel confident and comfortable with.

I listen, support, and guide you through every step of your health journey. I collaborate with trusted professionals and coordinate complex cases so that we can address all your needs
